Concurrency:
------------

- Concurrency refers to the ability of a system to handle multiple tasks or processes simultaneously. 
- It focuses on managing multiple tasks at once, which may or may not be executing at the same time. 
- Concurrency is more about the structure of a program and how it handles multiple tasks that could be in progress at the same time.


Example: 

If you have a web server that handles multiple incoming requests, it’s using concurrency to manage and respond to those requests, even if it’s not running all of them at exactly the same time.

Parallelism:
------------

- Parallelism refers to the simultaneous execution of multiple tasks or processes. 
- It involves breaking a problem into smaller parts that can be processed concurrently to achieve faster execution. - Parallelism focuses on performing multiple operations at the exact same time.

Example: 

If you have a multi-core processor and you run a task that can be divided into independent subtasks, those subtasks can be executed in parallel across different cores to speed up processing.
