Java Thread Methods:
----------------------

1. Join() method In Java :
---------------------------

- The join() method in Java allows one thread to wait until the execution of some other specified thread is completed.
- If t is a Thread object whose thread is currently executing, then t.join() causes the current thread to pause execution until t's thread terminates.
- Join() method puts the current thread on wait until the thread on which it is called is dead.

2. Sleep() Method :
-------------------

- The sleep() method in Java is useful to put a thread to sleep for a specified amount of time.
- When we put a thread to sleep, the thread scheduler picks and executes another thread in the queue.
- Sleep() method returns void.
- sleep() method can be used for any thread, including the main() thread also.

Syntax :
--------

- public static void sleep(long milliseconds)throws InterruptedException
- public static void sleep(long milliseconds, int nanos)throws InterruptedException

Parameters Passed To Sleep() Method :
-------------------------------------

- long millisecond: Time in milliseconds for which thread will sleep.
- nanos : Ranges from [0,999999]. Additional time in nanoseconds.

3. Interrupt() method :
-----------------------

- A thread in a sleeping or waiting state can be interrupted by another thread with the help of the interrupt() method of the Thread class.
- The interrupt() method throws InterruptedException.
- The interrupt() method will not throw the InterruptedException if the thread is not in the sleeping/blocked state, but the interrupt flag will be changed to true.
